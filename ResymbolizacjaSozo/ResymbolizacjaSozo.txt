MakeFont (fontname, style, size, forecolor, backcolor)

 fontname is a text string specifying a font (for example, "Arial"). This argument is case sensitive.  
 style is a positive integer expression; 0 = plain text, 1 = bold text, etc. See Font clause for details.
 size is an integer point size, one or greater.
 forecolor is the RGB color value for the text. See RGB( ) function.
 backcolor is the RGB color value for the background (or the halo color, if the style setting specifies a halo). 
  To make the background transparent, specify -1 as the background color.

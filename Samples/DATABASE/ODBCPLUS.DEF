'* SQL DataLink Programming Utility .Def file
'* Enables DataLink applications to harness and use QELIB and ODBC DLL functions!
'* Use these in conjunction with the SQL DataLink functions
'* server_getqehconn and server_getqehstmt
'*
'* Warning! These functions must be declared with their widened binary types
'* to avoid stack incompatability problems resulting in Internal Error 10003!
